# Troubleshooting Guide: Signup Verification & PayPal Payments

## üö® Current Issues

### 1. Signup Verification Emails Not Received
**Problem**: Users don't receive verification emails after signing up.

**Root Cause**: 
- `MAILERLITE_API_KEY` is not configured in `.env.local`
- Email service falls back to simulation mode
- Verification emails are only logged to console, not actually sent

**Solution**:
1. **For Development/Testing**: 
   - Check browser console for simulated email logs
   - Look for: `üìß Simulated email sent: { type: 'verification', data: {...} }`
   - The verification code is displayed in the console

2. **For Production**:
   - Set up MailerLite account at https://app.mailerlite.com/
   - Get API key from Integrations ‚Üí API
   - Add to `.env.local`: `MAILERLITE_API_KEY=ml_your_actual_api_key`

### 2. PayPal Payments Not Working
**Problem**: PayPal payments fail or don't process.

**Root Cause**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_SECRET` not configured
- System falls back to demo mode
- Real payments cannot be processed

**Solution**:
1. **For Development/Testing**:
   - System automatically uses demo mode
   - Payments are simulated successfully
   - Check console for: `üé≠ PayPal not configured, simulating payment success`

2. **For Production**:
   - Create PayPal Developer account at https://developer.paypal.com/
   - Get Client ID and Secret from your app
   - Add to `.env.local`:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
     PAYPAL_SECRET=your_actual_secret
     ```

## üîß Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Configuration
```bash
# Check if .env.local exists
ls -la .env.local

# If not exists, create it
cp env.template .env.local
```

### Step 2: Configure Email Service (Optional for Development)
1. Go to https://app.mailerlite.com/
2. Create account and get API key
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   MAILERLITE_API_KEY=ml_your_actual_api_key
   ```

### Step 3: Configure PayPal (Optional for Development)
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com/
2. Create app and get credentials
3. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
   PAYPAL_SECRET=your_actual_secret
   ```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)

### Email Verification in Demo Mode:
- ‚úÖ Verification emails are simulated in console
- ‚úÖ Users can still complete signup process
- ‚úÖ Check browser console for verification codes
- ‚úÖ All functionality works for testing

### PayPal Payments in Demo Mode:
- ‚úÖ Payments are simulated successfully
- ‚úÖ Subscription upgrades work
- ‚úÖ No real money is charged
- ‚úÖ Full testing capabilities

## üîç Debug Information

### Check Console Logs
Look for these messages in browser console:

**Email Service**:
```
üìß Simulated email sent: { type: 'verification', data: {...} }
üìß Email sent successfully via MailerLite: {...}
```

**PayPal Service**:
```
üé≠ PayPal not configured, simulating payment success
üí≥ PayPal payment result: { success: true, ... }
```

**Database**:
```
üíæ Upserting subscription in Supabase for user: user-123
‚úÖ Successfully upserted subscription in Supabase
```

### Environment Variable Status
The system logs configuration status:
```
üîê PayPal configuration check:
- Client ID set: false
- Secret set: false
üé≠ PayPal not configured, simulating payment success
```
